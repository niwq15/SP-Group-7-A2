#### Contributions

# Functions we each made versions of:
# Cameron - Strategy1, Strategy2, Strategy3, Pone, Pall, dloop
# Wenqi - Strategy1, Strategy2, Strategy3, Pone, Pall, dloop 
# Fatima - Strategy2, Pone, Pall, dloop 

# Further Details: 

# Cameron wrote the used Strategy 3 function and added an if statement to speed up the Pall function. 
# Some attempts were made to use arrays to write more efficient strategy functions but these were slower. 
# Other versions of Pone and Pall were also made but the final versions used were faster. 
# The dloop function written was not used as other members' dloops were better.


# Wenqi created the final versions of the functions Strategy 1, Strategy 2, Pone, Pall and the probability of no loop longer than 50 
# in a random reshuffling of cards. She wrote comments for these functions and those results. 
# She also provided a version of Strategy3, dloop function and the visualisation of the probabilities sensibly. 

# Fatima created an alternative version of Strategy 2 and pone. She created the final version of pall and dloop. 
# She also provided the sample solutions for various n and strategy combinations, and wrote comments to explain the results,
# generated the probability ditribution plot and returned the total probability of success for Strategy 1


#### Overview 
# This file holds the self-contained code to use stochastic simulation to study a generalised version of the famous '100 Prisoners Problem' 
# The problem is defined as follows: 
# Consider a prison containing 2n prisoners, each with a unique identification number ranging from 1 to 2n. 
# The prison has a room with 2n boxes, each uniquely numbered from 1 to 2n and each containing a single card. 
# These cards are each labelled with a unique number between 1 and 2n. 
# Each prisoner is allowed to open n boxes to find the card with their number.
# If all 2n prisoners successfully find their cards then they all go free. 
# After their turn,the prisoners are not allowed to communicate any new information from the boxes 
# to prisoners who have yet to take their turn.
# The room is returned to its original state after each prisonerâ€™s go. 

# Firstly, we will show 3 strategies for the prisoners, then create a 'Pone' function to estimate 
# the probability of a single prisoner successfully finding their number, then use a 'Pall' function to 
# calculate the probability of all the prisoners finding their numbers. 
# Based on the results of the individual and joint success probabilities using different strategies, 
# we will give some comments about which strategy has the highest success probabilities for 
# both individuals and the collective. 

## Each function expressing the different strategies for opening boxes to find cards will require the same 
## input parameters : n,k,cards_num. Where n parameterises the 2n number of boxes, prisoner and cards in our problem.
## k is the prisoner's number and cards_num represents the random orders of cards placed in boxes.
## Uniform input parameters allows the implemented strategy to be a variable in each simulation as each strategy 
## function is interchangeable. This is required by functions 'Pone' and 'Pall'.


## Strategy 1:

## The Strategy1 function has inputs, n, k, and 'cards_num' (the card numbers indexed by the box numbers). 
## Each prisoner with their number 'k' starts at the k-th box which contains card b. If k is not equal to b, then the prisoner 
## goes to box b and opens it. The process will be repeated until they have either found the card k or opened n boxes without finding it
## The Strategy1 function will return 'TRUE' if the prisoner k will find their number within the n tries, otherwise it will return 'FALSE'.
Strategy1 <- function(n,k,cards_num) {
  #create an empty vector to store card numbers as they are read
  cards_picked <- rep(0, n) # the prisoner can read at most n cards
  cards_picked[1] <- cards_num[k] # start at the box with his number (k) on it 
  #for each of the remaining steps, first check if he has found his card number
  #if so, he will stop; if not, he will continue to read cards
  for (b in 2:n) {
    if (cards_picked[b-1] == k) {#if the prisoner k has found his number
      return(TRUE) #yes the prisoner has successfully found his card
      break # stop here and the prisoner will not open other boxes
    } else {#otherwise prisoner will open another box with the number of the last card
      cards_picked[b] <- cards_num[cards_picked[b-1]]
    }
  }
  #check whether he finds his number in the final step
  if (cards_picked[n] != k) { #if the final number is not his number
    return(FALSE) #prisoner has failed to find his card
  } else {#if the final number is equal to his number
    return(TRUE) #prisoner has successfully found his card
  }
}

## Strategy 2:

## The Strategy2 function has inputs, n, k, and cards_num.
## This strategy follows an identical procedure to strategy 1, except that the starting box is randomly selected
## The prisoner uses the card number in each box to pick his next box to open.
## The prisoner can open at most n boxes in order to find the card with their number on it.
## The Strategy2 function will return 'TRUE' if the prisoner k will find their number within the n tries, otherwise 'FALSE'.
Strategy2 <- function(n,k,cards_num) {
  #create an empty vector to store card numbers that have been read
  cards_picked <- rep(0, n) # the prisoner can read at most n cards
  cards_picked[1] <- sample(cards_num,1)# start at a randomly selected box 
  #for each of the remaining steps, firstly check whether he has found him number card
  #if so, he will stop; if not, he will continue to read cards
  for (b in 2:n) {
    if (cards_picked[b-1] == k) {#if the prisoner k has found his number
      return(TRUE)
      break #stop here and the prisoner will not open other boxes
    } else {#otherwise prisoner will open the box with number k
      cards_picked[b] <- cards_num[cards_picked[b-1]]
    }
  }
  #check whether he finds his number in the final step
  if (cards_picked[n] != k) { #if the final number is not his number
    return(FALSE)
  } else {#if the final number is equal to his number
    return(TRUE)
  }
} #The function returns TRUE/FALSE expressing that the prisoner has FOUND/FAILED TO FIND his card 

## Strategy 3:
## The Strategy3 function has inputs, n, k, and cards_num.
## The prisoner opens n boxes at random, without replacement and the prisoner will open n different boxes. 
## The Strategy3 function will return 'TRUE' if the prisoner k will find their number within the n tries, otherwise 'FALSE'.
Strategy3 <- function(n,k,cards_num){ 
  cards_picked <- sample(cards_num,n,replace=FALSE) # Randomly select n boxes from cards_num to open
  any(k == cards_picked) # check whether the prisoner's number appears in the selected card_num
} # End function


## The 'Pone' function takes the inputs 'n', 'k', 'strategy' and 'nreps' (the number of replicate simulations).
## 'Pone' is a function which calculates the probability of an individual prisoner 'k' finding his card number amoungst 2n boxes. 
## The prisoner can open n boxes and the trial is simulated nreps times. In each simulation a set-up is generated and one strategy 
## is used for the prisoner's search. The outcome of each simulation is recorded (success/failure) and 
## (total number of successes/nreps) calculates the probability that the prisoner finds his card. This probability is the function output. 
Pone <- function(n,k,strategy,nreps) {
  # create an empty vector to store the outcome of each simulation as 1/0 = Success/ Failure to find his card
  success <- rep(0, nreps)
  for (i in 1:nreps) {
    # simulate the random order of card numbers
    cards_num <- sample(1:(2*n), 2*n, replace=FALSE)
    success[i] <- strategy(n,k,cards_num)
  }
  # return the frequentist probability of success as: 
  # total number of simulated successes / total number of simulations
  return(sum(success)/nreps)
}


## The 'Pall' function takes the inputs 'n', 'strategy' and 'nreps'.
## 'Pall' is a function to find the probability of all the 2n prisoners finding their cards in a single simulation
## and all being able to escape. All prisoners must use the same strategy. The probability is calculated by finding
## the total number of all prisoner successes and dividing by the number of simulations run (nreps).
## The Function then returns this probability as the output.
Pall <- function(n,strategy,nreps) {
  #create a vector to record the result of each simulation with default values of 1s
  num_success <- rep(1,nreps)
  for (i in 1:nreps) {#for each simulation
    #generate a random order of card numbers
    cards_num <- sample(1:(2*n), 2*n, replace=FALSE)
    #use the strategies to calculate whether each prisoner can find their correct number within n times
    for (k in 1:(2*n)) {
      result <- strategy(n,k,cards_num) # save the result of strategy for the k-th prisoner
      num_success[i] <- num_success[i] * result # if result is 1 keep 1 in the vector. If 0 change to 0.
      if (result == 0){ # stop if any prisoner does not escape, this cuts down simulation run-time
        break
      }
    }
  }
  # return the frequentist probability as: total number of simulated successes / total number of simulated trials
  return(sum(num_success)/nreps)
}

## Remarks

## Strategy 1 and Strategy 3 have similar individual success probabilities of 50%. 
## Strategy 1 has much higher joint success probability of above 30%, while Strategy 3 only has 0%.
## It demonstrates that there is something intelligent in Strategy 1's design.
## Strategy 2 has a lower marginal probability for success than the others, and a joint probability close to 0. 

## More explanations
## For Strategy 1, consider the distribution of maximum loop lengths amongst the boxes and cards. The cycle of box and card numbers 
## must eventually return the prisoner to open a box with his card number inside if he is allowed to open as many boxes as he wants, 
## as the numbers used are part of a finite sequence. Thus, the high joint success probability can be calculated as the cumulative 
## probability of the maximum loop length being less than n, which we have determined to be approximately 31%.

## For Strategy 2, the marginal probability is lower than 50% because the conditions for the prisoner's success are 1.the prisoner 
## select the correct loop with his card in it at random; 2.the loop he picks must also be shorter than n. 
## Our results show that the probability is about 37-40% (varies with n). The joint probability tends to 0 for the similar reason as strategy 3.

## For Strategy 3, the probability of finding their card every time they open a box is 1/2n and if he opens n boxes at random the 
## probability of finding his card is n/2n (=50%). For 2n prisoners all finding their cards in a simulation we multiply the independent 
## marginal probabilities to produce a joint probability of (0.5)^(2n), which tends to 0 as n increases. 


## The 'dloop' function has inputs: 'n' and 'nreps'. 
## It is a function which returns the probability distribution vector for each loop length occuring in a simulation.
## It takes the parameters n (making 2n boxes) and nreps (to make nreps simulations). In each simulation the boxes are 
## opened one by one while iterating through a loop, to find its length. The unique loop lengths from each simulation 
## are then tabulated and by nreps (the total number of simulations).
## This creates a probability vector (prob_vec_y = probability of each loop length occurring at least once),
## which is the output of the function.

#################### Alternative dloop function : 
## This version of dloop takes the same inputs n and nreps, and returns the same output, the probability distribution vector. 
## This version takes under 10 seconds on some devices but over 2 minuites on others (Cam's machine). We have included this version 
## because it uses the alternative interpretation of loops as nested objects and their lengths as the depth of nesting. 
##
## The method creates an empty array, 'loop_len' and uses simulation to count the occurrences of each 
## loop length ranging from 1 to 2n, which will be stored in the rows of 'loop_len'. Then we will convert the values to binary and give 1s to those 
## loop lengths which occur at least once. Based on the columns of 'loop_len', we can calculate the probability of each loop length occurring at least once.
## 
## dloop <- function(n,nreps) {
##  # create an empty array to store the number of occurrences of loops with lengths from 1 to 2n for each simulation
